Sample Proposed Solution-
This project proposes a “Styava.dev Developer Community App” (Prototype) so that developers can interact with other fellow developers, get good developer resources, get updates about upcoming events, and join different developer communities.
“Feel free to suggest some more features that you think are required as a Developer.”

## Sample Functionality & Concepts used:
The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the students select the upcoming event. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for students to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also use App Navigation to switch between different screens.
RecyclerView : To present the list of different communities use the efficient recyclerview. 
Google Maps API : You can also use the Google Maps API free version to get connected with local developer communities.
LiveData & Room Database : You can use LiveData to update & observe any changes in developer events received from their mobile at real time and update it to local databases using Room. 

## Sample Application Link & Future Scope:
The app is currently in the Alpha testing phase and tested in the “STYAVA.DEV” community with a limited no. of users. 
You can access the app : [YOUR APP LINK HERE](either Github link or Google Play store link of published app or .apk file).
Once the app is fully tested and functional in (your college / organization name), we plan to talk to neighboring communities also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this community app.
